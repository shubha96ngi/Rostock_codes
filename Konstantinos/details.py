# sodium current matches with INa_Ba2002 in sodium_compatible.py exactly ((Bazhenov, et, al. 2002)
# potassium current matches with IKDR_Ba2002 (same hi h IKDR_Ba2002v2)  in potassium_compatible.py 
# for other current from Nancy kopell 2022 paper 
#"A biophysical model of striatal microcircuits suggests gamma and beta oscillations interleaved at delta/theta frequencies mediate periodicity in motor control"
# it is not easy to set up these ion current for sodium, potassium, and M current 
# somehow to use sodiumfixed, potassium fixed, ..dont know about M current 
# not sure just writing definition will work
